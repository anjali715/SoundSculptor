Soundsculptor - Audio Waveform Visualization Tool

Soundsculptor is a web-based audio waveform visualization tool that allows users to upload audio files and visualize their waveforms in real-time. It provides an intuitive interface for users to interact with audio tracks, including playing, pausing, adjusting volume, and seeking to specific positions within the track.

Features
Upload Audio Files: Users can upload audio files by either dragging and dropping them onto the interface or by clicking the upload button and selecting files from their local file system.

Real-time Waveform Visualization: Once an audio file is uploaded, Soundsculptor generates a visual representation of its waveform in real-time, allowing users to see the amplitude of the audio signal over time.

Playback Controls: Soundsculptor provides playback controls such as play, pause, stop, and volume adjustment, allowing users to control the playback of audio tracks.

Seeking: Users can seek to specific positions within the audio track by clicking on the waveform visualization, allowing them to quickly navigate to different parts of the audio.

Multiple Audio Tracks: Soundsculptor supports the visualization of multiple audio tracks simultaneously, each with its waveform displayed in a separate waveform container.

Responsive Design: The interface is designed to be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience across devices.
